// simple hello world program
// the thing is a weird mix of python and java (also like dart) from what ive seen so far

// the language is strongly typed , compiled and doesnt carry much functionality outside of android app development

fun main(){
    print("Hello Nya!\n") // escape sequences are similiar to everything else
    print("I am vio ")
    println("this is another string") // println puts a newline character at the end
    print("yet enother string")
}
